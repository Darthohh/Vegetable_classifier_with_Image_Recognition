To reproduce the results of the vegetable classifier project using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries with a MobileNetV2 architecture we need to:
(1)	Setup the Environment; we used Visual Studio Code with Python 3.10, also we used tensorflow version 2.15 to avoid any errors.
(2)	Download the Dataset.
(3)	Define Paths: Change the paths for train_dir, test_dir, and val_dir in the script to match where you've stored the corresponding datasets on your system.
(4)	Load Image Paths and Generate DataFrames.
(5)	Configure the Image Data Generators.
(6)	Build and Compile the Model.
(7)	Train the Model.
(8)	Evaluate Model Performance using the graphs.
